\title{Prognostic high-grade serous ovarian cancer Signature}
\usage{
prognosticSign(dataset, nametype = "SYMBOL", tumorTissue = "ovary", age, stage)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Expression matrix. A data frame or a matrix where rows correspond to genes and columns correspond to samples.
A SummarizedExperiment which contains an assay represented by a matrix-like object of numeric. The rows typically represent
genomic ranges of interest and the columns represent samples.}

\item{nametype}{gene name ID of your dataset (row names).}

\item{age}{a vector of patient's age.}

\item{stage}{a vector of patient's tumor stage (FIGO).}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object in which the Prognostic scores will be added
in the `colData` section which contains sample meta-data describing the samples.
}
\description{
Given a dataset, based on a 101-gene expression signature by J. Millstein et. al (2020), prognosticSign returns the Quantile assignation for each sample
allowing to improve risk stratification in clinical trials by identifying patients who are least likely to achieve 5-year survival.
