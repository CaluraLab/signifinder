## Information on 'sysdata.rda' generation ##

For each signature collected inside signifinder, it was necessary to retrieve the correspondent list of genes in order to compute the signature scores.
More specifically, each signature has its own type of information needed for the computation. This could be:
- a list of genes;
- a list of genes and their coefficients;
- a list of genes and their class belonging;
- a list of genes, their coefficients and their class belonging;
- a list of genes and a specific type of information.

For each signature, we manually retrieved all the information from the original public work. Secondly, we checked gene ids and keeped only those genes that have a correspondent entrez id. Then, we constructed a data frame that contains the SYMBOL ids as the first column and the additional columns when it was required.
All these data frames are collected inside R/sysdata.rda.

Further, a table called 'signatureTable' is also included inside R/sysdata.rda. This is a data frame collecting all the main information about the signatures. This table can be easily explored using the function 'availableSignatures()', that also has a fully description of this table inside its documentation.
